## cowsay fun
This is simple script which i created to print quotes from **fortune** linux utility with random **cowsay** charactors.

### Requirement
Before running this you should have installed the _fortune_ and _cowsay_ packages. I am using Mac so i installed these packages using port.

#### Mac
```shell
sudo port install fortune cowsay
```

### Linux

#### Fedora
```shell
sudo yum install fortune cowsay
```
#### Ubuntu
```shell
sudo apt-get install fortune cowsay
```

> You can add this script to your bash config file.(i.e. ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile) to print fortume quote with random cowsay character each time you login to shell. Have Fun :)
